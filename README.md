# 3D-Lumbar-Spine-Creator

Lumbar Spine Creator generates an artificial model of the lumbar spine, including vertebrae L1-L5 and the sacrum.
The user can set the lumbar lordosis angle and a minimum and maximum value for the intervertebral disc height. 
Individual FSU parameters (angles and IVD height) are calculated based on a distribution, which depends on the selected subject position. 
Optionally, the respective parameters can be set for each FSU individually. The output includes the models of L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, SA, aligned as a coherent artificial lumbar spine, along with a table of measurements about the lumbar spine.
